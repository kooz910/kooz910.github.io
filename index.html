1.Tony Marston was young and strong. 
He didn’t die from some stimulant.
Perhaps he was poisoned.
And Mrs Rogers, perhaps she was given too much.
What drugs do you have in your medical bag, Doctor?
Why did you even bring it?
You are a guest, it’s not work.

2. Actually it is work.
I was trying to maintain some sort of professional discretion.
However, Mrs. Owen suffers from female neuroses.
My speciality is women’s disorders. 

Mr. Owen engaged me in a professional ocupacity to tend to his wife. 

3.Gave up on the surgery, then, Doctor!
1.	People do not just die out of no where for no reason.
The die because of something was done to them by someone!
I’m going to check you bag

2.Don’t you dare touch my possessions.
1.	What have you got to hide?
4. How about I do it?
2. I ‘m not being searched like some grubby criminal!
5. Then what if the General goes with him? (calmly)
He’s an honourable man!

2.	Fine! But while you’re at it, you might want to search Judge Wargrave’s case as well.I know where I’ve seen you before. 
Chap who has the clinic beneath mine in Harley Street,he’s cancer specialist. That’s where I saw you. If anyone has strong painkillers and sedatives in his case, it’s Judge Wargrave.
1.	Is that true Judge?
6. I have had health problems, yes. ( quiet)
1. Then, that’s very cruel, Doctor.
2. Don’t blame me, you push it.
7. General, Shall we?
