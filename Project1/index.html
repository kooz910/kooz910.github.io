<div class="a"><p>Tony Marston was young and strong.
He didn't die from some stimulant.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was <b>poisoned.</b> And Mrs Rogers, perhaps she was <b>given too much.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h1>What drugs do you have in your medical bag, Doctor?
<div>Why did you even bring it?</div></h1>
<p><div>You are a <b>guest</b>,</div>
<div><b>it's not work.</b></div></p></div>

<div class="b"><p>Actually, <b>it is work.</b></p>
<div>I was trying to maintain some sort of professional discretion.</div>
<div>However, Mrs. Owen suffers from female neuroses. My speciality is women's disorders.</div></p>
<div><b>Mr. Owen engaged me in a professional ocupacity to tend to his wife.</b></div></p></div>

<div class="c">Gave up on the surgery, then, Doctor!</div>

<div class="a"><div>People do not just die out of no where for no reason.</div>
<div>They die because of something was
done to them by someone!</div>
<p>I'm going to <b>check you bag.</b></p></div>

<div class="b"><div>Don't you dare</div>
<div><b>touch my possessions</b></div></div>
<div class="a"><h2>What have you got to hide?</h2></div>
<div class="d"><h3> How about I do it?</h3></div>
<div class="b">I'm not being searched like some grubby criminal!</div>
<div class="e"><div>Then what if the General goes with him?</div>
<div>He's an honourable man!</div></div>

<div class="b"><h4>FINE!</h4>
<div>But while you're at it, you might want to search Judge Wargrave's case as well. I know where I've seen you before.</div>
<div>Chap who has the clinic beneath mine in Harley Street, he's cancer specialist.That's where I saw you. If anyone has strong painkillers and sedatives in his case,</div>
<h5>it's Judge Wargrave.</h5></div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="a"><h6>Is that true Judge? <span class="f">I have had health problems, yes. (quiet)</span></h6>
Then, that's very cruel, Doctor</div>
<div class="b"><p>Don't blame me, you push it.</p></div>
<p></p>
<div class="d"><h3>General, Shall we?</h3></div>
