  <div class="a"><div>Tony Marston was young and strong.</div>
  <div>He didn't die from some stimulant.</div>
  <div>Perhaps he was <strong>poisoned.</strong> And Mrs Rogers, perhaps she was <strong>given too much.</strong></div>

  <h1>What drugs do you have in your medical bag, Doctor?
  <div>Why did you even bring it?</div></h1>
  <div class="line 1">You are a <strong>guest</strong>
  <div><strong>it's not work.</strong></div></div></div>
  <p></p>

  <div class="b">Actually, <strong>it is work.</strong><br></div>
  <div class="y">I was trying to maintain some sort of professional discretion.</div>
  <div class="y">However, Mrs. Owen suffers from female neuroses.</div>
  <div class="i">My speciality is women's disorders.
  <div>Mr. Owen engaged me in a professional ocupacity to tend to his wife.</div>

  <div class="c">Gave up on the surgery, then, <strong>Doctor!</strong></div>

  <div class="a"><div>People do not just die out of no where for no reason.</div>
  <div class="z">They die because of something was
  done to them by someone!</div>
  <div>I'm going to <strong>check you bag.</strong></div></div></div>

  <div class="g">Don't you dare</div><br>
  <div class="h">TOUCH MY POSSESSIONS.</div>
  <div class="a"><h2>What have you got to hide?</h2></div>
  <div class="d"><h3> How about I do it?</h3></div>
  <div class="j">I'm not being searched like some grubby <strong>criminal!</strong></div>
  <div class="e"><div>Then what if the General goes with him?</div>
  <div>He's an honourable man!</div></div>

  <div class="k"><strong>FINE!</strong>
  <div>But while you're at it, you might want to</div>
  <div>search Judge Wargrave's case as well.</div></div>
  <div class="m">I know where I've seen you before.
  <div>Chap who has the clinic beneath mine in Harley Street,</div>
  <div> he's cancer specialist. That's where I saw you.</div>
  <div> If anyone has strong painkillers and sedatives in his case,</div>
  <strong>it's Judge Wargrave.</strong></div>
  <br>
  <br><br>
  <div class="n"><h6>Is that true <strong>Judge?</strong> <span class="f">I have had health problems, yes. </span></h6>
  Then, that's very cruel, Doctor</div>
